## Title
Fix task execution issues with shell commands in file creation tasks

## Description
### Problem
When creating Python files using shell commands (`echo` and `cat`) through the workflow, syntax errors and invalid control characters were being introduced, causing task execution failures.

### Impact
- Files created with shell commands contained syntax errors
- Invalid control characters in generated files
- Failed task execution
- Poor error handling for file operations

### Root Cause
Using shell commands (`echo` and `cat`) to create Python files introduced encoding issues and escape character problems.

### Solution Implemented
1. Modified `FileTools` class to handle file operations directly:
   - Added proper UTF-8 encoding support
   - Improved error handling
   - Removed dependency on shell commands
2. Used direct file writing operations instead of shell commands
3. Added better logging for file operations

### Code Changes
- Updated `FileTools` class implementation
- Modified workflow to use direct file operations
- Added proper encoding handling
- Improved error messages and logging

### Testing Done
- Successfully created and executed Python files
- Verified file contents are properly encoded
- Confirmed no syntax errors in generated files
