Here’s a breakdown of how the interface could be structured based on your description, closely following the layout, features, and color scheme in the image:
﻿
### Web Interface Layout
﻿
#### **Overall Structure**
- **Two-Column Layout**: The page is split into two main vertical sections:
- **Left Side**: AI Dialog Module
- **Right Side**: File Processing Module
  
---
﻿
### Left Part: **AI Dialog Module**
﻿
1. **Header (Upper Left)**:
- **Model Selection Dropdown**: A dropdown menu or button (styled to match the image’s theme) allows users to choose AI models (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4).
- This header is fixed at the top of the AI module area for easy model switching.
﻿
2. **Main Dialog Area**:
- **Chat Window Style**: Displays conversation history between the user and AI in a scrollable container.
- **Message Bubbles**:
- **User Input**: Styled as user speech bubbles on the right side.
- **AI Response**: Styled as AI speech bubbles on the left side, with options for code snippets and text-based responses.
- **Scroll Bar**: A styled scroll bar for scrolling through the dialog history.
﻿
3. **User Input Box**:
- Positioned at the bottom of the dialog module.
- Allows users to enter text or commands to interact with the AI model.

### Right Part: **File Processing Module**
﻿
1. **Header (Upper Right)**:
- **Current Working Folder Display**: Shows the name of the current project folder.
- **File List**: Displays files and folders in a collapsible format with icons indicating:
- **File Type** (e.g., folder, Python file, text file).
- **Status Icon** (e.g., synced, unsynced, cloud status).
- **File Name and Type** (with matching text colors and icons from the image).
- **Size** of each file.
﻿
2. **Main File Area**:
- **Collapsible File Tree**: Allows users to expand/collapse folders for easy navigation.
- **Selectable Files**: Users can click on files to view or manage them in real time.
﻿
3. **Lower Right Section: Command Processing Information Area**
- **Command Input Box**: 
- An input field at the bottom where users can enter commands for code execution.
- **Execution Output Display**:
- Shows a scrollable area above the input box to display command outputs, debug information, or code results.
- **Code Block Display**:
- An area formatted to display code blocks with sections such as:
- **Explanation**: Summarizes code function.
- **Functions**: Lists out functions or definitions.
- **Test Steps**: Displays test cases and expected output.

﻿
### Styling Guidelines
﻿
- **Color Scheme**: 
- Use the same colors as in the image, mainly dark and grayscale tones with highlights for icons, buttons, and interactive elements.
  
- **Text Styling**:
- **File Names and Status**: Use different font weights or color shades to differentiate between folders and files.
- **Code Blocks and Outputs**: Monospaced font for code, with light background for readability.
  
- **Scroll Bars**:
- Style scroll bars to fit the dark theme, blending with the module background.

### Functionality Features
﻿
- **Dynamic Model Selection**: When a user selects a model from the dropdown, it updates the AI’s response style or behavior.
- **Real-time Dialog Updates**: Conversations between user and AI should update dynamically.
- **File Interactivity**: Users should be able to click files to view or run commands on them in the command input area.
- **Command Execution Display**: Commands typed in the input box display execution results above it in real-time, making it easier for debugging or tracking progress.
